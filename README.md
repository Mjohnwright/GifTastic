# GifTastic
Using APIs to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.

This is a fun website where the user can clicked on the themed "city" array and see Gifs that relate to that city.

To turn up the fun meter users can then click on the Gif to animate it.  Click it again and animation ceases.

As if it could not get any more awesome, users can add cities of their choosing to the array and explore endlessly.


I learned a lot about how to organize my code to make it easier for others to read and for me to debug.
